# My New personal website

 Rebuilt from scratch

## Tech Stack 
It's very simple and lightweight.

Uses: 
- HTMX for the presentation.
- DaisyUI for styling.
- Surreal js instead of vanilla js

That's it. 

No TypeScript. No Next.js. No React. No nonsense.

## Motivation
I've wanted to remake my old personal site (from back when I was a dev) but I've never gotten around to doing so.

Now, with AI-powered tools, I get another chance to build something new without the bloat of traditional JS frameworks. 

I can also avoid all the boring and time consuming parts of coding and focus on the important part (the content).

It can also work as a playground for trying out new stuff and as a new home for all my work across the Web.
